#### How to run the porject
1. Clone and download the repository.
2. Cd to the md5.c file directory
3. Compile the code by executing : Compile with: gcc -o md5 -O3 -lm md5.c
4. The run the code by executing: .\md5 "your string here"
5. After that the result will be printed to your console.
#### Research
I watched and followed the lecturer's video on coding up SHA56 in C. The final version of the SHA56 is also included in this repository in the file sha-256.c.
Also, I looked up online how different people have done the MDC in C and differnet langues. Two particular examples caught my attention. I started by following these examples and doing my project like in the examples. So, I can understand better and differnet concepts about MD5. I finally ended up doing my project in 3 different ways. The 3rd way was adapted from the two previous ways. All three ways are included in the md5.c file. The first two ways are commented out.
Here are some links are researched on 
- [Encode a string using an MD5 algorithm](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MD5).
- [Simple MD5 implementation](https://gist.github.com/creationix/4710780).
- [RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message Digest Algorithm](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Md5.c).
